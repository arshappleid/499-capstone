For our communications our client had prepared us a google document with meeting notes for each meeting every week. Each meeting notes comprised of Attendees, Agenda, Decisions, Action Items and Zoom Recording Link. We had our weekly meeting with our client every Tuesday at 4pm. Our weekly meeting were the main communication chanel and comprised of all our questions we had from our client in the Agenda section of each meeting.
